#### What does this project do?
This project is the future of ScriptEd's Hackathons, so we've created an app to take you through the sign up, team matching, submission process in 2099, and at the end we render a 3D model of your project.

#### Challenges we ran into
One of our struggles was merging our individual works. We overcame this obstacle by communicating well with each other and having well defined roles in our teams, including a project developer who was responsible for putting every thing together. When we ran into technical problems like trying to use a library called Particle JS, we worked together to find alternative solutions, and we were able to make a fully functioning app.

#### What did we learn?
We learned technical skills like how to incorporate our code in functions, how to append videos, how to make hover appear and disappear, and most importantly how to work as a good team.

#### Why is your project awesome?
Our project is awesome because it is the future of ScriptEd's Hackathons - a future where they incorporate both hardware and software engineering!
